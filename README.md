Built-in feature from Next.js:

- ðŸ’¨ Live reload
- âœ… Cache busting

### Philosophy

- Minimal code
- SEO-friendly
- ðŸš€ Production-ready

### Requirements

- Node.js 14+ and npm

### Getting started

Run the following command on your local environment:

```shell
yarn install
#or
npm run install
```

Then, you can run locally in development mode with live reload:

```shell
yarn dev
#or
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your favorite browser to see your project.

### Deploy to production

You can see the results locally in production mode with:

```shell
$ yarn build
$ yarn start
```

The generated HTML and CSS files are minified (built-in feature from Next js). It will also removed unused CSS from [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

You can create an optimized production build with:

```shell
npm run build-prod
```

Now, your blog is ready to be deployed. All generated files are located at `out` folder, which you can deploy with any hosting service.

### Testing

All tests are colocated with the source code inside the same directory. So, it makes it easier to find them. Unfortunately, it is not possible with the `pages` folder which is used by Next.js for routing. So, what is why we have a `pages.test` folder to write tests from files located in `pages` folder.

### VSCode information (optional)

If you are VSCode users, you can have a better integration with VSCode by installing the suggested extension in `.vscode/extension.json`. The starter code comes up with Settings for a seamless integration with VSCode. The Debug configuration is also provided for frontend and backend debugging experience.

With the plugins installed on your VSCode, ESLint and Prettier can automatically fix the code and show you the errors. Same goes for testing, you can install VSCode Jest extension to automatically run your tests and it also show the code coverage in context.

Pro tips: if you need a project wide type checking with TypeScript, you can run a build with <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> on Mac.
